# flock

**new flock experiments**

### Build instructions:
- Clone repository, cd to flock directory.
    - `mkdir build`
    - `cd build`
- Generally only once:
    - `cmake ..`
- For each edit:
    - `cmake --build .`
    - `./flock`
    
On macOS, I use Homebrew to install CMake, GLEW, and GLFW.
